          <p class="light section-paragraph" editable="true" editable-title="estate" editable-type="paragraph">A personalized experience with a skilled attorney is the best way to ensure that your wishes are carried out in the event that you are unable or unavailable to make such decisions.&nbsp;More than simply printing out documents, Adam Slate takes the time to develop a clear picture of his client’s situation before any document is drafted. &nbsp;He strives to develop trusting relationships with his clients, to understand their needs when drafting a legal document, and to allow for and encourage client feedback throughout the drafting process.&nbsp; Additionally, this process must involve client input to ensure accurate representation.&nbsp; A relationship that begins with trust always yields the best results.</p>
          <p class="light section-paragraph" editable="true" editable-title="estate" editable-type="paragraph">You need peace of mind when it comes to protecting your interests as well as ensuring that all that you have saved is passed on in the way you have decided. Adam Slate approaches estate planning in a unique way. He will take the time to understand your estate, and the results you are seeking, before discussing the best method to reach those desired results.</p>
          <p class="light section-paragraph" editable="true" editable-title="estate" editable-type="paragraph">Adam Slate can help you establish a Durable Power of Attorney and a Medical Durable Power of Attorney to ensure that your wishes will be carried out, during your lifetime, in the event that you are incapacitated or unable to do so.&nbsp; A Will can also ensure that minor children are cared for and that the wealth you have accumulated during this life will be passed on in the way that you desire.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Organizing a new business is a significant and exciting endeavor for the budding entrepreneur. However, it can also become a complicated and involved undertaking.&nbsp; Assistance from a trusted attorney offers the peace of mind that the legal structure will meet the organization's needs and desires.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Establishing your business as a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Organization can be beneficial in a number of ways.&nbsp; Once you are established, any donation made to your organization is tax deductible.&nbsp; This status is crucial for would-be donors interested in contributing to your organization's purpose and vision.&nbsp; Utilizing an attorney for this process will give you peace of mind and enable you to negotiate the application process with ease.&nbsp; Adam Slate can assist in drafting your organization’s Articles of Incorporation according to your organizational needs.&nbsp; If you already have Articles of Incorporation, an attorney can help you update them to suit your present situation.&nbsp; Adam Slate can assist you in articulating your organizational goals through the Articles of Incorporation and the process of gaining non-profit status.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Other types of business organizations offer protection for your personal assets in the event that the organization is financially liable under certain circumstances.&nbsp; Establishing a corporation or a limited liability corporation (LLC) can shield an individual from being personally liable for debts incurred by the business.&nbsp; Once the LLC is established, business owners can protect personal assets from those liabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;Adam Slate can discuss the unique objectives of your business and be there with you along the way to see those objectives through.&nbsp;</p>
